# Rhea's Online Documentation Sample

## Introduction
This is the sample of online documentation. The materials within this documentation were randomly captured from google with key word "technical documentation".


## Scope
This online documentation will only cover materials of Code Documentation, explanation about technical writer ,and general guidance to write a good technical documentation for IT project.


## Technical Documentation
### What is Technical Documentation?
In my understanding and opinion, Technical Documentation is a set of documentation deliverables that consists of Code Documentation, Functional Specification Documentation (FSD), and User Manual.

However, as mentioned in the Scope section, this online documentation will only cover materials about **Code Documentation, technical writer, and general guidance to write a good technical documentation for IT project**.

### Code Documentation
Code documentation is a documentation provided by a Technical Author or the developer itself to give explanation about the code, how it works, eplanationa about what is the input, what process(es) available, and what is the output. 

The sytle in writing Code Documentation depends on the audience. In general, there can be at least 2 (two) type of audience for this documentation, namely The Developer and The Operator.

Mainly, the focus for Developer is **what the code does and how the code does it**. On the other hand, the operator wants to know **how to use the code**.

**1. Code Documentation for Developers (Maintainers)**
This docmentation is intended to provide explanation for new developer who join the team and need to continue someone else's code. By reading this documentation, it is expected that the new developer will be able to grasp understanding of the code faster and can continue to code easier.

One documentation is not enough to help the new developer understands the code or the system easier, it needs the other supporting documentations, such as System Design Documentation, API Specification, README, Contribution Guide, FAQ, and if possible a wiki.

**2. Code Documentation for Operator (external user)**
This documentation is more like an online manual. It guides use how to operate the application and explains each feature within the application.


## Technical Writer
Unfortunately, in the country of my origin, the profession of Technical Writer was not widely known. At least until late 2015. However, luckily it is not the case in the UK and US. Even though Technical Writer or also known as Technical Author in the UK is quite widely known, not many people really understand the role and what it takes to be a technical writer (author).

To be a technical writer, one must have technical skills. Preferably those who graduated from computer-related major or someone who has experience in writing code. Thus, Technical Writer not only writer. Moreover, other than having strong technical skills, it is obvious that a technical writer must also have passion and capability in writing too. These combination of two skills is what makes technical writer role unique.

Technical Writer is someone who is expected to be able to translate technical terms, such as raw code, into a documentation that can be understood by common people without strong technical background.


## Writing a Technical Documentation
Based on my research about this subject on Google, here are what I have found:
1. Always remember that **the purpose of writing technical documentation is to inform and educate**, so that is has to be **readble and comprehensive**
2. Sentences must be **short and clear (less is more)**
3. Use **active-voice and instructive-voice**
4. Write everything in the **present tense**
5. **Avoid** to use **contractions and abreviations**

> Code can communicate **“what”** it does. But only **comments can communicate “why”** it does it!
>> **“why”** is a broader truth that simply cannot be expressed in code. It involves requirements, feelings, experience, etc.
